# Orlando Vibes — Editorial Identity

A locally focused digital media platform that operates like a modern online city magazine.

## What It Is

### 1. City Storytelling Platform
Publishes long-form articles about:
- Neighborhoods
- Cultural shifts
- Community stories
- Lifestyle trends

Tone is thoughtful and civic-minded — NOT click-driven.

### 2. Development & Real Estate Explainer
One of the strongest angles — covering:
- New construction projects
- Urban growth
- Redevelopment areas
- Market movement

Translates what's happening in the city into clear, readable narratives.

### 3. Neighborhood Intelligence Hub
Breaks down:
- What different areas feel like
- Who they're attracting
- How they're evolving
- Why they matter

Attracts both residents and people considering a move.

### 4. Cultural Curator
Highlights:
- Restaurants
- Local businesses
- Experiences
- Creative communities

With context and analysis — not just lists.

## What It Is NOT
- ❌ A tourism site
- ❌ A coupon blog
- ❌ Just a food page
- ❌ Generic "top 10" listicles
- ❌ AI-sounding filler
- ❌ Stock photo content

## In Simple Terms
A city-focused media brand that blends culture, neighborhoods, and development into a polished editorial platform. A digital city publication that builds authority around what's happening locally.
